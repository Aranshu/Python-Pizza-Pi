# SDLC Activity Based Learning
* The application should prompt the user to enter a diameter of a pizza in inches and then present the area of each pizza slice based in multiple possible configurations. The user should then able to either enter another diameter or indicate that they want to quit by entering ‘0’. Pizzas may be cut into up to 6, 8, 10, 12, or 16 slices dependent on the pizza size. The application should prompt for entry of a diameter and only process and display results if the entered diameter is in the range of 8” to 24” inclusive. When an invalid diameter is entered, (other than 0 to end) a message should be displayed and the user should be re-prompted for entry of a valid diameter.
